Location: New York, NY / Hybrid Remote / Remote within USA (EST / CST time zone)

We have an office in New York City and this position can either be based in the office, hybrid remote, or remote within the EST/CST time zones (subject to your existing legal right to work in the jurisdiction).

About HERE

Everything works right here™.

Traditional browsers weren't built for work. In today's enterprise environment—where security threats are constant and productivity is critical—legacy browsers fall short. That's why we built HERE, the browser purpose-built for work.

Powered by Chromium, HERE Enterprise Browser combines enterprise-grade security, seamless productivity, and native AI integration in one secure, intelligent workspace. Designed for regulated industries, HERE offers deep policy controls, identity-based access, secure workspace isolation, and full interoperability across SaaS, legacy, and virtualized environments. Our platform enables teams to work faster, more securely, and more intelligently—without compromise.

HERE technology is trusted by 90% of global banks and also used within the U.S. Intelligence Community and other sectors. We're backed by some of the world's most respected financial institutions and venture firms, including Bain Capital Ventures, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and IQT, the not-for-profit strategic investor that accelerates the introduction of groundbreaking technologies to enhance the national security of America and its allies.

About the Role

HERE is seeking a mid-junior DevOps Engineer to join our infrastructure team! The primary responsibilities for this role will span CI/CD pipeline engineering and cloud operations, maintaining and improving our GitHub and GitLab CI/CD pipelines, and supporting our AWS cloud infrastructure. In this role, you will gain hands-on experience with real production build systems and cloud platforms- while having the opportunity to work on practical projects that directly impact both our development velocity and operational reliability.

We're actively evolving toward a cloud-agnostic, multi-cloud architecture and migrating to Kubernetes for container orchestration. While current AWS and ECS experience is essential, having exposure to Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes will position you well for our infrastructure roadmap.

This role offers the opportunity to collaborate with senior engineers who will provide guidance and mentorship, whilst giving you ownership of projects across the DevOps lifecycle. This is an excellent platform for building practical experience with modern build engineering (CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and deployment practices) within a production environment.

Responsibilities


CI/CD Pipeline Development:
Build, maintain, and optimize GitLab CI/CD pipelines for multi-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Work with YAML configurations, pipeline stages, artifacts, and deployment workflows.
Cloud Infrastructure Operations:
Help maintain and improve AWS infrastructure including ECS/Fargate deployments, RDS databases, Route53 DNS, VPC networking, and IAM policies.
Support multi-tenant and multi-region architecture.
Container & Deployment Management:
Work with Docker containers, ECS task definitions, and ECR registries.
Deploy and manage containerized Node.js applications in production environments.
Release Management:
Help manage release processes including version promotion, release channels (canary, beta, stable), and automated deployment to staging and production environments.
Database Operations:
Support PostgreSQL on AWS RDS—backups, SSH tunneling through bastion hosts, read-only user management, and database configuration for multi-tenant environments.
Automation & Scripting:
Write and maintain automation scripts in Bash, PowerShell, Python, and Node.js.
Build tools to improve infrastructure reliability and developer experience.
Internal Tools Support:
Help maintain web-based DevOps tools built with Express.js, React, and TypeScript—tools for cloud settings management, tenant provisioning, and deployment monitoring.

What We're Looking For

Ideally 2 to 4 years of experience with the following core requirements:


GitLab CI/CD: Experience with GitLab CI/CD pipelines—YAML configuration, stages, jobs, artifacts, rules, dependencies.
Understanding of CI/CD best practices and pipeline optimization.
AWS Cloud Fundamentals: Practical experience with core AWS services—EC2, ECS/Fargate, RDS, Route53, VPC, IAM, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch. Comfortable navigating the AWS Console and CLI.
Multi-Platform Scripting: Solid scripting skills in Bash (Linux) and PowerShell (Windows). Ability to write maintainable automation scripts for both platforms.
Containerization: Hands-on Docker experience—building images, writing Dockerfiles, docker-compose, understanding container networking, and working with ECS/ECR.
Build Systems: Experience with build tools and package managers—npm/Node.js, .NET/NuGet, Python packaging. Understanding of dependency management and build artifacts.
Version Control: Strong Git fundamentals—branching strategies, merge requests, tagging. Experience with GitHub (or GitLab) workflows and code review practices.
Linux/Unix & Windows: Comfortable in both environments—SSH, file permissions, package managers, systemd, PowerShell. Understanding of cross-platform operational challenges.
Node.js/JavaScript: Comfortable reading and writing JavaScript/Node.js code. Experience with npm, package.json, and basic Express.js applications for tooling.


Nice to Have


Kubernetes experience (EKS, GKE, AKS) or willingness to learn, we're migrating from ECS to K8s
Multi-cloud experience (Azure, GCP) or cloud-agnostic architecture knowledge
GitLab Runner administration and configuration
AWS CDK or CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code
Terraform for multi-cloud infrastructure management
TypeScript development experience

Collate is an AI document generation platform for life sciences. We automate paperwork with AI, helping our customers get life-saving innovations to patients years faster. Collate is an end-to-end solution, powering every step of drug, diagnostic, and medical device development—from concept to market.

Our CEO Surbhi Sarna is a former General Partner at Y Combinator. Surbhi founded nVision Medical, which developed a new method to detect ovarian cancer and was acquired by Boston Scientific. Our CTO Nate Smith is a former Visiting Partner at Y Combinator and founder of Lever. Our AI researchers, engineers, and designers have worked at Google, Nvidia, Meta, Netflix, Amazon, AirBnB, Hippocratic AI, and Grail, and 40% of our team are former founders.

We’re a small, elite team, with over $30M in seed funding from top investors (Redpoint, First Round Capital, Conviction, and Y Combinator) and leaders in healthcare and AI. This is a rare chance to join at the ground floor of a company with world-changing potential, experienced founders, and resources to execute at scale.

About The Role

We’re looking for a DevOps / Systems Engineer to own the infrastructure that powers Collate’s products. You’ll build the systems and tooling that keep our platform reliable, secure, and fast as we scale.

This role is broad by design — from managing CI/CD pipelines and cloud infrastructure to handling light security responsibilities like certificate management. You’ll partner closely with backend, AI, and product engineers to ensure our systems are both easy to develop on and safe to deploy at scale.

At Collate, infrastructure isn’t just about uptime — it’s about trust. The work you do will help ensure that the AI we build for healthcare runs with reliability and security in mind.

What You’ll Do


Design and maintain cloud infrastructure to support Collate’s products as we grow from prototypes to production scale
Develop CI/CD pipelines and automation that accelerate developer velocity and reduce operational friction
Manage core system reliability, including monitoring, logging, and incident response
Take on light security responsibilities, such as handling certificates, secrets management, and supporting compliance needs
Collaborate closely with engineering teams to design infrastructure that balances speed, safety, and scale
Continuously improve internal tooling and workflows, helping the team move faster with confidence
Leverage tooling including AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD, Grafana, and Github Actions



What We’re Looking For


Hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or similar) and modern DevOps practices
Proficiency with infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD tooling
Familiarity with monitoring, observability, and incident management
Interest or experience in light security work, including certificates, secrets management, or compliance support
A pragmatic approach: able to balance iteration speed with building for long-term reliability
Motivation to work in an early-stage startup where your infrastructure decisions shape the foundation of the company



Why Join Collate?

Impact: Build systems and experiences that touch real patients and providers, improving healthcare outcomes.

Ownership: Shape both our product experience and our engineering culture from the start.

Learning: Collaborate with a uniquely interdisciplinary team—AI researchers, healthcare leaders, and experienced startup builders.

Upside: Join a company early enough to have meaningful equity and career-defining impact.

The base salary range for this role is $150,000–$300,000 USD annually, depending on experience and level (Tier 1, San Francisco)

We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.

Location: New York, NY / Hybrid Remote / Remote within USA (EST / CST time zone)

We have an office in New York City and this position can either be based in the office, hybrid remote, or remote within the EST/CST time zones (subject to your existing legal right to work in the jurisdiction).

About HERE

Everything works right here™.

Traditional browsers weren't built for work. In today's enterprise environment—where security threats are constant and productivity is critical—legacy browsers fall short. That's why we built HERE, the browser purpose-built for work.

Powered by Chromium, HERE Enterprise Browser combines enterprise-grade security, seamless productivity, and native AI integration in one secure, intelligent workspace. Designed for regulated industries, HERE offers deep policy controls, identity-based access, secure workspace isolation, and full interoperability across SaaS, legacy, and virtualized environments. Our platform enables teams to work faster, more securely, and more intelligently—without compromise.

HERE technology is trusted by 90% of global banks and also used within the U.S. Intelligence Community and other sectors. We're backed by some of the world's most respected financial institutions and venture firms, including Bain Capital Ventures, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and IQT, the not-for-profit strategic investor that accelerates the introduction of groundbreaking technologies to enhance the national security of America and its allies.

About the Role

HERE is seeking a mid-junior DevOps Engineer to join our infrastructure team! The primary responsibilities for this role will span CI/CD pipeline engineering and cloud operations, maintaining and improving our GitHub and GitLab CI/CD pipelines, and supporting our AWS cloud infrastructure. In this role, you will gain hands-on experience with real production build systems and cloud platforms- while having the opportunity to work on practical projects that directly impact both our development velocity and operational reliability.

We're actively evolving toward a cloud-agnostic, multi-cloud architecture and migrating to Kubernetes for container orchestration. While current AWS and ECS experience is essential, having exposure to Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes will position you well for our infrastructure roadmap.

This role offers the opportunity to collaborate with senior engineers who will provide guidance and mentorship, whilst giving you ownership of projects across the DevOps lifecycle. This is an excellent platform for building practical experience with modern build engineering (CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and deployment practices) within a production environment.

Responsibilities


CI/CD Pipeline Development:
Build, maintain, and optimize GitLab CI/CD pipelines for multi-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Work with YAML configurations, pipeline stages, artifacts, and deployment workflows.
Cloud Infrastructure Operations:
Help maintain and improve AWS infrastructure including ECS/Fargate deployments, RDS databases, Route53 DNS, VPC networking, and IAM policies.
Support multi-tenant and multi-region architecture.
Container & Deployment Management:
Work with Docker containers, ECS task definitions, and ECR registries.
Deploy and manage containerized Node.js applications in production environments.
Release Management:
Help manage release processes including version promotion, release channels (canary, beta, stable), and automated deployment to staging and production environments.
Database Operations:
Support PostgreSQL on AWS RDS—backups, SSH tunneling through bastion hosts, read-only user management, and database configuration for multi-tenant environments.
Automation & Scripting:
Write and maintain automation scripts in Bash, PowerShell, Python, and Node.js.
Build tools to improve infrastructure reliability and developer experience.
Internal Tools Support:
Help maintain web-based DevOps tools built with Express.js, React, and TypeScript—tools for cloud settings management, tenant provisioning, and deployment monitoring.

What We're Looking For

Ideally 2 to 4 years of experience with the following core requirements:


GitLab CI/CD: Experience with GitLab CI/CD pipelines—YAML configuration, stages, jobs, artifacts, rules, dependencies.
Understanding of CI/CD best practices and pipeline optimization.
AWS Cloud Fundamentals: Practical experience with core AWS services—EC2, ECS/Fargate, RDS, Route53, VPC, IAM, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch. Comfortable navigating the AWS Console and CLI.
Multi-Platform Scripting: Solid scripting skills in Bash (Linux) and PowerShell (Windows). Ability to write maintainable automation scripts for both platforms.
Containerization: Hands-on Docker experience—building images, writing Dockerfiles, docker-compose, understanding container networking, and working with ECS/ECR.
Build Systems: Experience with build tools and package managers—npm/Node.js, .NET/NuGet, Python packaging. Understanding of dependency management and build artifacts.
Version Control: Strong Git fundamentals—branching strategies, merge requests, tagging. Experience with GitHub (or GitLab) workflows and code review practices.
Linux/Unix & Windows: Comfortable in both environments—SSH, file permissions, package managers, systemd, PowerShell. Understanding of cross-platform operational challenges.
Node.js/JavaScript: Comfortable reading and writing JavaScript/Node.js code. Experience with npm, package.json, and basic Express.js applications for tooling.


Nice to Have


Kubernetes experience (EKS, GKE, AKS) or willingness to learn, we're migrating from ECS to K8s
Multi-cloud experience (Azure, GCP) or cloud-agnostic architecture knowledge
GitLab Runner administration and configuration
AWS CDK or CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code
Terraform for multi-cloud infrastructure management
TypeScript development experience

We have an office in New York City and this position can either be based in the office, hybrid remote, or remote within the EST/CST time zones (subject to your existing legal right to work in the jurisdiction).

About HERE

Everything works right here™.

Traditional browsers weren't built for work. In today's enterprise environment—where security threats are constant and productivity is critical—legacy browsers fall short. That's why we built HERE, the browser purpose-built for work.

Powered by Chromium, HERE Enterprise Browser combines enterprise-grade security, seamless productivity, and native AI integration in one secure, intelligent workspace. Designed for regulated industries, HERE offers deep policy controls, identity-based access, secure workspace isolation, and full interoperability across SaaS, legacy, and virtualized environments. Our platform enables teams to work faster, more securely, and more intelligently—without compromise.

HERE technology is trusted by 90% of global banks and also used within the U.S. Intelligence Community and other sectors. We're backed by some of the world's most respected financial institutions and venture firms, including Bain Capital Ventures, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and IQT, the not-for-profit strategic investor that accelerates the introduction of groundbreaking technologies to enhance the national security of America and its allies.

About the Role

HERE is seeking a mid-junior DevOps Engineer to join our infrastructure team! The primary responsibilities for this role will span CI/CD pipeline engineering and cloud operations, maintaining and improving our GitHub and GitLab CI/CD pipelines, and supporting our AWS cloud infrastructure. In this role, you will gain hands-on experience with real production build systems and cloud platforms- while having the opportunity to work on practical projects that directly impact both our development velocity and operational reliability.

We're actively evolving toward a cloud-agnostic, multi-cloud architecture and migrating to Kubernetes for container orchestration. While current AWS and ECS experience is essential, having exposure to Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes will position you well for our infrastructure roadmap.

This role offers the opportunity to collaborate with senior engineers who will provide guidance and mentorship, whilst giving you ownership of projects across the DevOps lifecycle. This is an excellent platform for building practical experience with modern build engineering (CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and deployment practices) within a production environment.

Responsibilities


CI/CD Pipeline Development:
Build, maintain, and optimize GitLab CI/CD pipelines for multi-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Work with YAML configurations, pipeline stages, artifacts, and deployment workflows.
Cloud Infrastructure Operations:
Help maintain and improve AWS infrastructure including ECS/Fargate deployments, RDS databases, Route53 DNS, VPC networking, and IAM policies.
Support multi-tenant and multi-region architecture.
Container & Deployment Management:
Work with Docker containers, ECS task definitions, and ECR registries.
Deploy and manage containerized Node.js applications in production environments.
Release Management:
Help manage release processes including version promotion, release channels (canary, beta, stable), and automated deployment to staging and production environments.
Database Operations:
Support PostgreSQL on AWS RDS—backups, SSH tunneling through bastion hosts, read-only user management, and database configuration for multi-tenant environments.
Automation & Scripting:
Write and maintain automation scripts in Bash, PowerShell, Python, and Node.js.
Build tools to improve infrastructure reliability and developer experience.
Internal Tools Support:
Help maintain web-based DevOps tools built with Express.js, React, and TypeScript—tools for cloud settings management, tenant provisioning, and deployment monitoring.

What We're Looking For

Ideally 2 to 4 years of experience with the following core requirements:


GitLab CI/CD: Experience with GitLab CI/CD pipelines—YAML configuration, stages, jobs, artifacts, rules, dependencies.
Understanding of CI/CD best practices and pipeline optimization.
AWS Cloud Fundamentals: Practical experience with core AWS services—EC2, ECS/Fargate, RDS, Route53, VPC, IAM, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch. Comfortable navigating the AWS Console and CLI.
Multi-Platform Scripting: Solid scripting skills in Bash (Linux) and PowerShell (Windows). Ability to write maintainable automation scripts for both platforms.
Containerization: Hands-on Docker experience—building images, writing Dockerfiles, docker-compose, understanding container networking, and working with ECS/ECR.
Build Systems: Experience with build tools and package managers—npm/Node.js, .NET/NuGet, Python packaging. Understanding of dependency management and build artifacts.
Version Control: Strong Git fundamentals—branching strategies, merge requests, tagging. Experience with GitHub (or GitLab) workflows and code review practices.
Linux/Unix & Windows: Comfortable in both environments—SSH, file permissions, package managers, systemd, PowerShell. Understanding of cross-platform operational challenges.
Node.js/JavaScript: Comfortable reading and writing JavaScript/Node.js code. Experience with npm, package.json, and basic Express.js applications for tooling.

Location: New York, NY / Hybrid Remote / Remote within USA (EST / CST time zone)

We have an office in New York City and this position can either be based in the office, hybrid remote, or remote within the EST/CST time zones (subject to your existing legal right to work in the jurisdiction).

About HERE

Everything works right here™.

Traditional browsers weren't built for work. In today's enterprise environment—where security threats are constant and productivity is critical—legacy browsers fall short. That's why we built HERE, the browser purpose-built for work.

Powered by Chromium, HERE Enterprise Browser combines enterprise-grade security, seamless productivity, and native AI integration in one secure, intelligent workspace. Designed for regulated industries, HERE offers deep policy controls, identity-based access, secure workspace isolation, and full interoperability across SaaS, legacy, and virtualized environments. Our platform enables teams to work faster, more securely, and more intelligently—without compromise.

HERE technology is trusted by 90% of global banks and also used within the U.S. Intelligence Community and other sectors. We're backed by some of the world's most respected financial institutions and venture firms, including Bain Capital Ventures, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and IQT, the not-for-profit strategic investor that accelerates the introduction of groundbreaking technologies to enhance the national security of America and its allies.

About the Role

HERE is seeking a mid-junior DevOps Engineer to join our infrastructure team! The primary responsibilities for this role will span CI/CD pipeline engineering and cloud operations, maintaining and improving our GitHub and GitLab CI/CD pipelines, and supporting our AWS cloud infrastructure. In this role, you will gain hands-on experience with real production build systems and cloud platforms- while having the opportunity to work on practical projects that directly impact both our development velocity and operational reliability.

We're actively evolving toward a cloud-agnostic, multi-cloud architecture and migrating to Kubernetes for container orchestration. While current AWS and ECS experience is essential, having exposure to Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes will position you well for our infrastructure roadmap.

This role offers the opportunity to collaborate with senior engineers who will provide guidance and mentorship, whilst giving you ownership of projects across the DevOps lifecycle. This is an excellent platform for building practical experience with modern build engineering (CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and deployment practices) within a production environment.

Responsibilities


CI/CD Pipeline Development:
Build, maintain, and optimize GitLab CI/CD pipelines for multi-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Work with YAML configurations, pipeline stages, artifacts, and deployment workflows.
Cloud Infrastructure Operations:
Help maintain and improve AWS infrastructure including ECS/Fargate deployments, RDS databases, Route53 DNS, VPC networking, and IAM policies.
Support multi-tenant and multi-region architecture.
Container & Deployment Management:
Work with Docker containers, ECS task definitions, and ECR registries.
Deploy and manage containerized Node.js applications in production environments.
Release Management:
Help manage release processes including version promotion, release channels (canary, beta, stable), and automated deployment to staging and production environments.
Database Operations:
Support PostgreSQL on AWS RDS—backups, SSH tunneling through bastion hosts, read-only user management, and database configuration for multi-tenant environments.
Automation & Scripting:
Write and maintain automation scripts in Bash, PowerShell, Python, and Node.js.
Build tools to improve infrastructure reliability and developer experience.
Internal Tools Support:
Help maintain web-based DevOps tools built with Express.js, React, and TypeScript—tools for cloud settings management, tenant provisioning, and deployment monitoring.

What We're Looking For

Ideally 2 to 4 years of experience with the following core requirements:


GitLab CI/CD: Experience with GitLab CI/CD pipelines—YAML configuration, stages, jobs, artifacts, rules, dependencies.
Understanding of CI/CD best practices and pipeline optimization.
AWS Cloud Fundamentals: Practical experience with core AWS services—EC2, ECS/Fargate, RDS, Route53, VPC, IAM, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch. Comfortable navigating the AWS Console and CLI.
Multi-Platform Scripting: Solid scripting skills in Bash (Linux) and PowerShell (Windows). Ability to write maintainable automation scripts for both platforms.
Containerization: Hands-on Docker experience—building images, writing Dockerfiles, docker-compose, understanding container networking, and working with ECS/ECR.
Build Systems: Experience with build tools and package managers—npm/Node.js, .NET/NuGet, Python packaging. Understanding of dependency management and build artifacts.
Version Control: Strong Git fundamentals—branching strategies, merge requests, tagging. Experience with GitHub (or GitLab) workflows and code review practices.
Linux/Unix & Windows: Comfortable in both environments—SSH, file permissions, package managers, systemd, PowerShell. Understanding of cross-platform operational challenges.
Node.js/JavaScript: Comfortable reading and writing JavaScript/Node.js code. Experience with npm, package.json, and basic Express.js applications for tooling.


Nice to Have


Kubernetes experience (EKS, GKE, AKS) or willingness to learn, we're migrating from ECS to K8s
Multi-cloud experience (Azure, GCP) or cloud-agnostic architecture knowledge
GitLab Runner administration and configuration
AWS CDK or CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code
Terraform for multi-cloud infrastructure management
