Comfortable navigating the AWS Console and CLI.\nMulti-Platform Scripting: Solid scripting skills in Bash (Linux) and PowerShell (Windows). Ability to write maintainable automation scripts for both platforms.\nContainerization: Hands-on Docker experience—building images, writing Dockerfiles, docker-compose, understanding container networking, and working with ECS/ECR.\nBuild Systems: Experience with build tools and package managers—npm/Node.js, .NET/NuGet, Python packaging. Understanding of dependency management and build artifacts.\nVersion Control: Strong Git fundamentals—branching strategies, merge requests, tagging. Experience with GitHub (or GitLab) workflows and code review practices.\nLinux/Unix & Windows: Comfortable in both environments—SSH, file permissions, package managers, systemd, PowerShell. Understanding of cross-platform operational challenges.\nNode.js/JavaScript: Comfortable reading and writing JavaScript/Node.js code. Experience with npm, package.json, and basic Express.js applications for tooling.\n\n\nNice to Have\n\n\nKubernetes experience (EKS, GKE, AKS) or willingness to learn, we're migrating from ECS to K8s\nMulti-cloud experience (Azure, GCP) or cloud-agnostic architecture knowledge\nGitLab Runner administration and configuration\nAWS CDK or CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code\nTerraform for multi-cloud infrastructure management\nTypeScript development experience\nPostgreSQL database administration and optimization\n.NET build systems and NuGet package management\nReact or frontend framework experience\nAirflow or workflow orchestration tools\nHelm charts and Kubernetes manifest management\n\n\nWhat We're Offering\n\nBenefits -\n\n\nGenerous Paid Time Off, Paid Holidays & Sick Time\nCompetitive & Comprehensive Health Insurance\nThoughtfully-Planned Paid Parental Leave\nFinancial Well-Being Plans (FSA) (401k) (Life Insurance)\nStock Options\nProfessional Development Courses\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\n\nAdditional Perks -\n\n\nOne Medical - Free Membership\nTalkspace - Mental Health Therapy 24/7\nTeam Lunches\nCasual dress code\nCommuter Benefits (NYC employees only)\nCitibike (NYC employees only)\n\n\nLife at HERE\n\nAt HERE, we pride ourselves on fostering a friendly, collaborative, and supportive culture that truly respects the diversity of thought.

In today's enterprise environment—where security threats are constant and productivity is critical—legacy browsers fall short. That's why we built HERE, the browser purpose-built for work.\n\nPowered by Chromium, HERE Enterprise Browser combines enterprise-grade security, seamless productivity, and native AI integration in one secure, intelligent workspace. Designed for regulated industries, HERE offers deep policy controls, identity-based access, secure workspace isolation, and full interoperability across SaaS, legacy, and virtualized environments. Our platform enables teams to work faster, more securely, and more intelligently—without compromise.\n\nHERE technology is trusted by 90% of global banks and also used within the U.S. Intelligence Community and other sectors. We're backed by some of the world's most respected financial institutions and venture firms, including Bain Capital Ventures, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and IQT, the not-for-profit strategic investor that accelerates the introduction of groundbreaking technologies to enhance the national security of America and its allies.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nHERE is seeking a mid-junior DevOps Engineer to join our infrastructure team! The primary responsibilities for this role will span CI/CD pipeline engineering and cloud operations, maintaining and improving our GitHub and GitLab CI/CD pipelines, and supporting our AWS cloud infrastructure. In this role, you will gain hands-on experience with real production build systems and cloud platforms- while having the opportunity to work on practical projects that directly impact both our development velocity and operational reliability.\n\nWe're actively evolving toward a cloud-agnostic, multi-cloud architecture and migrating to Kubernetes for container orchestration. While current AWS and ECS experience is essential, having exposure to Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes will position you well for our infrastructure roadmap.\n\nThis role offers the opportunity to collaborate with senior engineers who will provide guidance and mentorship, whilst giving you ownership of projects across the DevOps lifecycle. This is an excellent platform for building practical experience with modern build engineering (CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and deployment practices) within a production environment.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\nCI/CD Pipeline Development:\nBuild, maintain, and optimize GitLab CI/CD pipelines for multi-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux).\nWork with YAML configurations, pipeline stages, artifacts, and deployment workflows.\nCloud Infrastructure Operations:\nHelp maintain and improve AWS infrastructure including ECS/Fargate deployments, RDS databases, Route53 DNS, VPC networking, and IAM policies.\nSupport multi-tenant and multi-region architecture.\nContainer & Deployment Management:\nWork with Docker containers, ECS task definitions, and ECR registries.\nDeploy and manage containerized Node.js applications in production environments.\nRelease Management:\nHelp manage release processes including version promotion, release channels (canary, beta, stable), and automated deployment to staging and production environments.\nDatabase Operations:\nSupport PostgreSQL on AWS RDS—backups, SSH tunneling through bastion hosts, read-only user management, and database configuration for multi-tenant environments.\nAutomation & Scripting:\nWrite and maintain automation scripts in Bash, PowerShell, Python, and Node.js.\nBuild tools to improve infrastructure reliability and developer experience.\nInternal Tools Support:\nHelp maintain web-based DevOps tools built with Express.js, React, and TypeScript—tools for cloud settings management, tenant provisioning, and deployment monitoring.\n\nWhat We're Looking For\n\nIdeally 2 to 4 years of experience with the following core requirements:\n\n\nGitLab CI/CD: Experience with GitLab CI/CD pipelines—YAML configuration, stages, jobs, artifacts, rules, dependencies.\nUnderstanding of CI/CD best practices and pipeline optimization.\nAWS Cloud Fundamentals: Practical experience with core AWS services—EC2, ECS/Fargate, RDS, Route53, VPC, IAM, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch. Comfortable navigating the AWS Console and CLI.\nMulti-Platform Scripting: Solid scripting skills in Bash (Linux) and PowerShell (Windows). Ability to write maintainable automation scripts for both platforms.\nContainerization: Hands-on Docker experience—building images, writing Dockerfiles, docker-compose, understanding container networking, and working with ECS/ECR.\nBuild Systems: Experience with build tools and package managers—npm/Node.js, .NET/NuGet, Python packaging. Understanding of dependency management and build artifacts.\nVersion Control: Strong Git fundamentals—branching strategies, merge requests, tagging. Experience with GitHub (or GitLab) workflows and code review practices.\nLinux/Unix & Windows: Comfortable in both environments—SSH, file permissions, package managers, systemd, PowerShell. Understanding of cross-platform operational challenges.\nNode.js/JavaScript: Comfortable reading and writing JavaScript/Node.js code. Experience with npm, package.json, and basic Express.js applications for tooling.\n\n\nNice to Have\n\n\nKubernetes experience (EKS, GKE, AKS) or willingness to learn, we're migrating from ECS to K8s\nMulti-cloud experience (Azure, GCP) or cloud-agnostic architecture knowledge\nGitLab Runner administration and configuration\nAWS CDK or CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code\nTerraform for multi-cloud infrastructure management\nTypeScript development experience\nPostgreSQL database administration and optimization\n.NET build systems and NuGet package management\nReact or frontend framework experience\nAirflow or workflow orchestration tools\nHelm charts and Kubernetes manifest management\n\n\nWhat We're Offering\n\nBenefits -\n\n\nGenerous Paid Time Off, Paid Holidays & Sick Time\nCompetitive & Comprehensive Health Insurance\nThoughtfully-Planned Paid Parental Leave\nFinancial Well-Being Plans (FSA) (401k) (Life Insurance)\nStock Options\nProfessional Development Courses\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\n\nAdditional Perks -\n\n\nOne Medical - Free Membership\nTalkspace - Mental Health Therapy 24/7\nTeam Lunches\nCasual dress code\nCommuter Benefits (NYC employees only)\nCitibike (NYC employees only)\n\n\nLife at HERE\n\nAt HERE, we pride ourselves on fostering a friendly, collaborative, and supportive culture that truly respects the diversity of thought.
